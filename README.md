# Puray for Potato Devices

[Puray](https://puray.moe) is a brazilian anime website. Unfortunately, my computer barely runs YouTube, imagine a whole unoptimized anime website. This is a simple website built around Puray's API, making it possible for me to watch anime on potatoes.

## Quick Start

Start a http server on the root of this repo. For debugging purposes, i use [Python's http.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).

```console
$ python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `localhost:8080` on your browser.
